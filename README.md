# Emoticon Keyboard

## introduction
This is a android library for using the emoticon keyboard. It provided a emoticon font and some emoticon images for use. You can also you use your own font or emoticon images.

## support
As we known, the color emoji also support android 4.4 and above, so I make a EmoticonEditText and a EmoticonTextView to support others.

## usage
See the demo. The MainActivity is a old demo, please see the NewActivity which is the new way to control the soft keyboard. Also, it is not in the library. You can see the usage of the library in MainActivity.

## maven or gradle
Later I will push it to the bintray.

## screen captures
Later I will make a gif for it.
